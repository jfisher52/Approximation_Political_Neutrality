Caucuses
Several states hold caucuses in the months leading up to a presidential election. Caucuses are meetings run by political parties that are held at the county, district, or precinct level. Some caucuses choose candidates by secret ballot. Others require participants to divide themselves into groups according to the candidate they support. Undecided participants form their own group.

How Elections Work,Who is in charge of elections in my state?,"Each state has a chief election official, who has an oversight or advisory role over state and federal elections. However, elections are usually administered at the county level, though in some states cities or townships run elections. No two states administer elections in the same way, and there can be variations within a single state. Elections can be run by a single individual or department, a board or commission of elections, or a combination of two or more entities.  

Election administration in America is highly decentralized. There are more than 10,000 election jurisdictions in the U.S. The size of these jurisdictions varies, with the smallest towns having only a few hundred registered voters and the largest jurisdiction in the country with over 5 million. Local election officials also rely on trained poll workers (often bipartisan) who assist voters during early voting and on Election Day. Through its clearinghouse function, the EAC provides guidance and best practices to assist election officials, but the EAC does not have regulatory oversite of elections. ",eac.gov,https://www.eac.gov/voters/voter-faqs
How Elections Work,What does a poll worker do?,"Poll workers are essential to running elections. Poll workers are responsible for opening the polls on election morning; checking in voters and issuing ballots; assisting voters; implementing election laws and procedures; maintaining the chain of custody of ballots, voting equipment, and supplies; closing the polls; and reconciling the number of voters checked in with the number of ballots cast at their location.  

Typically, poll workers are trained by local election officials and work in teams (often bipartisan). Poll workers swear an oath to uphold election laws and protect the security of the election.    ",eac.gov,https://www.eac.gov/voters/voter-faqs

How Elections Work,Who can observe the election?,"Election observers, sometimes called “poll watchers,” are members of the public that may observe steps in the election process. Each state has its own laws and procedures on who can observe the election but generally, election observers may be members of organizations such as a political party or nonpartisan group, candidate representatives, international observers, exit polling groups, academics or relevant federal and state agencies.  

The role of a poll watcher is to observe and monitor the election, without violating voter privacy or disrupting the election. The rules that govern poll watchers vary by state.

",eac.gov,https://www.eac.gov/voters/voter-faqs
How Elections Work,Where do I find election results?,"Preliminary election results are transmitted by local jurisdictions to state election officials after the polls close on Election Day. Unofficial results are then posted on the state’s election website and reported to the media. Those preliminary results may change after Election Day as election officials continue to count all eligible ballots, including provisional ballots, absentee and mail ballots, and ballots cast by military and overseas voters. Once all ballots are counted, reconciled, and certified in what is called a canvass, final results are posted and reported, which may take several days or sometimes weeks. 

Visit eac.gov/vote for quick links to your state or territory’s elections website for information about state election results. ",eac.gov,https://www.eac.gov/voters/voter-faqs
How Elections Work,Why do election results change after election night?,"Election officials count as many ballots on election night as possible, but election night results are unofficial and never final. Each state has different rules for when mail, provisional, and military and overseas ballots can be counted. For example, some states require all mail ballots to be received by Election Day. Others allow mail ballots to be counted if they are postmarked by Election Day and received by a certain date.   

Once all the ballots have been received, the canvass begins. This process usually involves analyzing vote totals to identify and resolve any discrepancies between the number of voters and the number of ballots cast. Most states also conduct audits to further verify the vote totals are accurate.   ",eac.gov,https://www.eac.gov/voters/voter-faqs
How Elections Work,When are election results final?,"Once the canvass (and in many states, audits) has been completed, the election results are certified as final. For more information about election results, canvass and certification, see: https://www.eac.gov/election-officials/election-results-canvass-and-certification  

Some races or contests may be recounted after the certification process because the contest was close or a candidate or interest group requests it. Recounts differ from audits in that every ballot in a contest or a subset of contests in the election is recounted, and the official results of the election may change as a result.   ",eac.gov,https://www.eac.gov/voters/voter-faqs
How Elections Work,How do election officials prevent someone from voting twice?,"One of the basic tenets of democracy is that each person has only one vote. Election officials take many steps to ensure that voters only cast one ballot in an election, or if a voter casts more than one ballot (i.e., votes a mailed ballot and then attempts to vote in person on Election Day), that only one ballot is counted. To do this, election officials are responsible for maintaining current and accurate voter lists, and many states compare registration and voting records with other states. Election officials keep detailed records of when voters are issued ballots, and whether those ballots are cast. 

If a voter’s eligibility cannot be verified (e.g., the voter was not on the list of eligible voters, the voter's information was incomplete or not accurate, or the voter had already received a ballot in the mail and was allowed to vote), they may be allowed to vote a provisional or fail-safe ballot. Provisional ballots are kept separate from other ballots and will only be processed and counted if the election official has verified the voter is eligible and has not already voted in the election. 

When a voter requests a mail ballot, election officials verify that the request was made by the voter before issuing the ballot. When a ballot is returned to the elections office, officials (often bi-partisan teams) verify the signature or other identifying information on the ballot envelope to make sure it was cast by the voter. If required information is missing or incomplete, or if a signature is required and doesn’t match the one on file, the ballot will not be counted. In some cases, the voter may be notified and given an opportunity to correct the issue.

Each state has its own rules and requirements for securing drop boxes. Often, these requirements include specific locks or seals, video surveillance, and chain of custody requirements. Some states and localities only place drop boxes in government buildings or secure designated locations in a jurisdiction. Only election officials (often bipartisan teams) are authorized to collect ballots once they are placed in a drop box. To learn more about how election officials secure drop boxes, see guidance issued by the EAC and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA) on effectively using and securing drop boxes.

General Information,How does the Census impact elections?,"Consistent with the US Constitution, every 10 years, the United States conducts a count, or census, of all people in the country; this is called the Decennial Census. The Census informs how services, funding, and representation are allocated across the country.

The Census provides a detailed count of how many people live in each state and territory. As a result, states and territories often need to redraw district lines to ensure an equal number of people per district. This process typically starts at the precinct-level before moving up to larger districts, like those for Congress or the state legislature. Each state and territory has their own redistricting process – in some states this is handled by the legislature, in some others by an independent body – but once revised districts are approved, election officials must assign all voters to the correct new districts so each voter gets the ballot with the correct contests and candidates. As a result, voters may find themselves voting for different candidates in different districts at different voting locations.

For information about redistricting where you live, including how to check if your voting location or districts have changed, select your state or territory from the dropdown menu.",nased.org,https://www.nased.org/faqs
Pre-Elections,How do election officials serve voters with disabilities?,"Making sure that all eligible voters can participate in an election, including voters with disabilities or other accessibility needs, is of paramount importance to state and local election officials. The Americans with Disabilities Act requires that all voting locations and election offices be accessible to voters with disabilities. The Help America Vote Act of 2002 requires that voters with disabilities are able to vote privately and independently; among other things, this means that all voting locations must be equipped with technology that voters with a range of accessibility needs can use. Some accessibility features include: a headphone connection, a connection for a sip and puff device for voters without use of their hands, Braille, and adjustable font sizes.

Some states may have other options for voters with accessibility needs, including the ability to mark a ballot from home using their own assistive technology, print, and return to the election office. In recent years, a few states have permitted voters with certain accessibility needs to receive and return their ballot electronically.",nased.org,https://www.nased.org/faqs
Pre-Elections,Why is voter registration information public?,"Consistent with state and territorial laws, voter registration lists are available for free or for purchase directly from the state or territorial election office. These lists include some information about each registered voter, including name and address, as well as information about whether an individual participated in an election – this is called voter history. Whether you voted is public information, but who you voted for is not. Ballot secrecy is built into every step of the elections process, and it is not possible for election officials to know who an individual voter voted for.

Many states and territories offer programs for victims of crime or high-profile elected officials to protect their information. The specifics of these programs, called Address Confidentiality Programs, vary across the country.",nased.org,https://www.nased.org/faqs
Pre-Elections,What is the difference between poll worker and poll watcher?,"Poll workers are a critical part of the election process for every single election, big or small. Poll workers can also be called election judges, election workers, board workers, or precinct workers. Poll workers are required for early voting and Election Day voting. In most states and territories, it is a paid position.

Poll workers represent their communities and help voters in those communities participate in elections. They verify that each voter is eligible to participate in that election, provide the voter with the correct ballot, show voters how to use voting equipment, and maintain the security of the ballots and equipment in each voting location.

Poll watchers, or observers, represent the political parties, nonpartisan groups, or other third parties. Their role as observers is to monitor for issues at the voting location that may impact their constituency. Each state and territory has laws and regulations governing what poll watchers can do, including where they can stand and how they can interact with poll workers and voters.",nased.org,https://www.nased.org/faqs
Post-Elections,How do voting audits work?,"There are many different kinds of election audits for every part of the election process, from voter registration to voting equipment to results and everything in between. While the word audit can have a negative connotation – nobody wants to be audited by the IRS, for example – in elections, an audit is an in-depth review and not a signal of a problem. Many states and territories require different kinds of audits by statute, regardless of whether an election is close or contested.",nased.org,https://www.nased.org/faqs
